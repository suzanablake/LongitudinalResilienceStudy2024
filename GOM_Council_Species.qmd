#King Mackerel and Spanish Mackerel: These species are also managed under this category and include specific regulations for both commercial and recreational fisheries​​.
Other Categories
#Shrimp: Includes various species of shrimp managed to ensure sustainable harvests and conservation of the ecosystem.
#Spiny Lobster: Managed to balance commercial and recreational harvesting while ensuring the species' sustainability.
#Corals and Coral Reefs: Includes measures to protect coral habitats and associated species.
#Red Drum: Management focuses on rebuilding and maintaining sustainable populations.

##Essential Fish Habitat (EFH): This encompasses protections for habitats critical to the lifecycle of various managed species
